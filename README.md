# school-projects
A few school projects I did during my time at Lulea University of Technology

# Courses
Each folder is a course I took at university and these contain a few projects made for that particular course. Many of them contain a project called lab-env-master which is the "base project" we got to work with in most of courses. It contains a few libs and functions needed for us to be able to do our assignments. 
The courses I have added so far are:
* Game Consoles and Systems
* Graphics Programming and Algorithms
* Focus Project
* Game Project

# Game Consoles and Systems
In this course we made half edge meshes for subdivision, tried som IOS development as well as made a fast and small "replica" of Pacman with an Arduino. 
The projects added in this repository so far are "Pacman", "Rasterizer" and "Half-Edge Meshes".

# Graphics Programming and Algorithms
In this course we got to create a skeleton, animate it and skin it. We had to parse files commonly known files as well as files which our teachers have developed (NAX3 and NVX2).

# Focus Project 
During my third year at university we got the opportunity to select any subject related to our programme and learn more about that particular subject. In this project I created an application which tales user input to create terrain procedurally by using noise.

# Game Project
During the second year at university we had a course called "Game Project" where we got to work in teams of developers and graphics artists (all students at Lulea University of Technology). My group was a group of 8 people (3 graphics artists and 5 developers).
The goal was to create a first-person puzzle game. Other than that we got to do whatever we wanted. Our game is called "Timeline" and it was a game where the player jumped between time to solve puzzles in different "dungeons". Trailer for the game can be found here: https://vimeo.com/218087163
