# Focus Project
During my third year at university we got the opportunity to select any subject related to our programme and learn more about that particular subject. I selected procedural generation and noise. In this project I created an application which tales user input to create terrain procedurally by using noise. I got some inspiration from a few algorithms (mostly Perlin Noise) and then created my own. This is what I accomplished during the 6 weeks we had the course.
