# Game Project
During the second year at university we had a course called "Game Project" where we got to work in teams of developers and graphics artists (all students at Lulea University of Technology). My group was a group of 8 people (3 graphics artists and 5 developers).
The goal was to create a first-person puzzle game. Other than that we got to do whatever we wanted. Our game is called "Timeline" and it was a game where the player jumped between time to solve puzzles in different "dungeons". We also got to work with a few sound engineer students who created all our sound effects and music according to our game design documents. Trailer for the game can be found here: https://vimeo.com/218087163

# About
The game was developed in Autodesk's game engine Stingray and all programming was done with the language lua. Not the whole project is commited here since it would take up to much space, but a few scripts, the set up to install the game and a video filmed during development.

# My contribution
The whole group sat down and came up with concept, features and general ideas about the game. When everyone was one the same page about what kind of game we wanted to do we started to divide responsibilities. We worked in an agile environment using Scrum and I was Scrum master. My other responsibilities beyond the work we did together, I worked mostly with:
* Player movement 
* Teleportation feature of the player
* Interaction with objects functionality - such as levers, buttons, doors etc.
* Inventory
* UI programming and menu construction 
* Sound programming - adding sound effects, ambient sounds and music to the game.

Other assignments I worked some on was:
* Save/load
* Options - key bindings
